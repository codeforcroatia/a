# Our Assets and Usage Guidelines

Assets and Usage Guidelines (http://a.codeforcroatia.org) are a collection of logos and other web component resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to use Code for Croatia logos and other components.

Assets in this repository are as a read-only web assets and it should be as light as possible. Never add a file directly onto gh-pages: always do a Pull Request so someone else can verify the file belongs here.

What does belong here:

- images
- css
- html
- anything that is used across multiple Code for Croatia web properties

What does not belong here:

- Javascript libraries
- Presentations
- General documents
- Images for blog posts

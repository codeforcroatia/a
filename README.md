## Goals

## Under the Hood

This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an open source static site generator. This means the Jekyll program takes the content we want to be on the site and turns them into HTML files ready to be hosted somewhere. Awesomely, GitHub provides free web hosting for repositories, called [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), and that's how this site is hosted. The content for the site is on a branch named [gh-pages](https://github.com/codeforcroatia/assets/tree/gh-pages).

## Licenses

The site is open source (here's all the code!) and is a tool _for_ and _by_ the community.

Code, including source files and code samples if any in the content, is released under CC0-1.0, with the following exceptions:

- The primer components in node_modules are under the MIT license; see LICENSE in each componentâ€™s directory
- The Octicons images are under the SIL OFL 1.1

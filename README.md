This is a new repository only to be used for read-only web assets. This repository should be as light as possible.

Never add a file directly onto gh-pages: always do a PR so someone else can verify the file belongs here.

What does belong here:

- images
- css
- html
- anything that is used across multiple CfC web properties

What does not belong here:

- Javascript libraries
- Presentations
- General documents
- Images for blog posts

Inspiration for this comes from a.okfn.org.

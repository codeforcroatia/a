If you have any questions about your project, we encourage you to do your own research, seek out experts, and discuss with your community. If you have any legal questions, you should consult with your own legal counsel before moving forward. If you're at a company, [talk to its legal team](../legal/#what-does-my-companys-legal-team-need-to-know).
